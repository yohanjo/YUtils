4915222,3,F_NoOne,F_NoOne,"Data Analytics Cycle Data Analysis begins with a question which we are trying to answer. Once we have our question and we have identified our data sources, the process of analysis begins. Three key stages pertaining to Analytics are: Preparing to run the model/ analysis. Running the model/ analysis. Interpreting and Communicating the results Stage 1: Preparing to run the model: This is the most challenging and most critical of all the steps involved. The data that we get could be structured or unstructured. It is not always in the format we need. The challenge then is to clean it and process it to transform into a state where we can start our analysis. Some of the steps involved are : Collection and acquisition Cleaning Integration Restructuring Merging Clean: The raw data that we access is most of the times is dirty and not in a state where we could start the analysis work. For example, some of the data points may be missing or dates or curreny format may not be consistent across the records. The first step therefore is about the cleaning of the data. Tools like openrefine.org can be made use of for the process. Shape: Before we begin our analysis, data should be in tidy format which means that each variable that we measure should be in one column and every observation of that variable should be in a separate row. Data in wide format may have to be converted into narrow format before analysis. Augmenting: Sometimes the data is spread across multiple tables or sources. In order to do the analysis and get an complete picture the data should be augmented from various sources Stage 2: Conducting the analysis: Once we have the processed the raw data, we can start with the analysis work. Analysis can be of many types depending of the type of study. It can range from a simple descriptive analysis to predictive analysis. Descriptive Analysis Exploratory Inferential Predictive Causal Mechanistic Descriptive analysis is about describing the data and it does not involve decision making. Exploratory analysis as the name suggests is about exploring the data to discover new relationships or connections but not necessarily confirm them. Discovery of any relationship can further lead to more rigorous analysis. Inferential analysis is about drawing the inference about the population at larger through statistical analysis of a small random sample drawn from the population. Predictive analysis is about predicting a value of a variable in a after training a predictive model on a training dataset. Stage 3: Interpretation and Communicating the results: Once the analysis is complete, the results can be published for wider audience. Since the larger audience may not be technical it is important to communicate the results in the manner which can be readily understood by them. Visualization makes analytics products available to the broadest possible audience. It helps us make sense of complexity. Appropriate use of charts, visualization and dashboards make the communication of results more effective. Data can be visually represented in many formats like Sankey Diagrams, charts, tables etc. Once we have the data/ results in the pictorial format we can start interpretation of answers through the below means: Look for outliers Look for similarities and differences Look for patterns Look for trends View on maps Sample Visualization using Tableau This is an example of Basic Tableau analysis completed for Data, Analytics, and Learning course in EDX. Tableau is an easy-to-use analytics and data visualization tool that is used to create interactive, sharable dashboards to get quick insight into the data. Raw Data Description: The Raw data consisted of academic details for a set of students enrolled in a university. The following fields were present in the data: AcademicYear, Course Level, Full Name, MEANEVAL Score (bin) , Mini, Number , Section, Semester, Title, Units, Year, # of Responses, # of Students Enrolled, Course Mean Eval Score, COURSES EVALUATIONS, Instructor Mean Eval Score, INSTRUCTORS, MEANEVAL, MEANEVAL (bin) The table shows the number of students enrolled in various streams. Number of students in MBA far outweighs those in other courses. Av Score Distribution The histogram shows that the average score is 4 and maximum number of MBA students score that. Av score across course levels: Although MBA has highest number of students enrolled, the course does not record the highest score. In fact the average score in MBA is below average Score and Enrollment Trend: This graph shows the average score and total enrollment trend across all the courses in various semesters starting from year 2005 to 2014. The graph shows that MBA enrollment is higher in Fall as compared to Spring and Summer. While the number of MBA enrollments have increased from 2005 onwards, there was a sharp decrease in 2011. Fluctuations in MBA enrollments in Fall is more pronounced than in Spring and Summer. The course score in MSCF is showing more fluctuations over the years as compared to MBA. Sample social network analysis using Gephi | Presented here is a very basic social network analysis of four networks completed through Gephi. Gephi is an opensource tool for social network analysis. Network1 Network Overview Density 0.4 Average degree 3.6 Diameter 4 Density is 0.4 which means that given the number of nodes there is a possibility of many more connections. However, only 40% of possible connections have materialized.

These nodes as seen in the graph are positioned in such a way in the network that they can reach any other nodes in lesser number of hops as compared to others. Highest Value: Lisa has the highest value of closeness centrality. As seen in the graph, Lisa is positioned at one end of the network and would need more hops to reach to nodes at the opposite end as compared to others. Betweeness Centrality: Highest: Liz has the highest value. As seen in the graph, Liz acts like a network broker between nodes on one end to Lisa and Allen. It is impossible to reach to Allen and Lisa without Liz coming in between. Lowest: Minimum value is 0 for Mike, Leah and Lisa. As seen in the graph these nodes lie at the periphery of the network and it possible to reach to other nodes bypassing them. In other words they are not needed in between by any of the nodes to access any other node. Degree: Jill has highest number of connections with others. As seen in the graph she is connected to six other nodes which is highest for any node. The least is for Lisa as she is at one end of network and has just one connection Network 2 Network overview: Density 0.208 Average degree 3.125 Diameter 5 Node Details Label Degree Closeness Centrality Betweenness Centrality Modularity Class Bob 4.00 2.58 0.83 0.00 John 4.00 2.58 0.83 0.00 Mike 3.00 2.67 0.00 0.00 Emma 5.00 2.08 15.83 0.00 Jill 6.00 2.42 3.67 0.00 Shane 5.00 2.08 15.83 0.00 Leah 3.00 2.67 0.00 0.00 Liz 3.00 1.92 35.00 0.00 Allen 3.00 2.17 32.00 1.00 Lisa 4.00 2.67 14.00 1.00 Tom 3.00 2.75 4.50 1.00 Merry 2.00 3.50 0.00 1.00 Mark 3.00 3.42 0.50 1.00 Jen 1.00 1.00 0.00 2.00 Sean 1.00 1.00 0.00 2.00 Mia 0.00 0.00 0.00 3.00 degree Betweeness- Denoted by color.

4915222,4,F_NoOne,F_NoOne,"Social Network Analysis Overview Social Network is a representation of the relationship between various actors in a network. Actors could be people, groups, organizations, computers, Web sites or any other information/knowledge processing entities. Actors represent nodes and relationships or interactions are represented by edges. Linkage between the nodes acts as channels for exchange of flow of resources. Social network analysis (SNA) is the mapping and measuring of relationships, connection power and flows between actors leading us to identify how we can best interact to share knowledge. Data for SNA can be collected through surveys, email logs, discussion forums, phone logs, twitter etc. In analyzing networks we evaluate the location of actors in the network and these measures provide insight into the types of roles and groupings in a network e.g. who are the knowledge holders or gatekeepers, connectors, leaders, bridges, isolates, where are the clusters and who is in them, who is in the core of the network, and who is on the periphery, with consequences for how the network 'functions' and the individuals within it behave. Numerous SNA metrics are available for analyzing groups and the individuals within groups. Metrics (measures) in social network analysis Diameter: Diameter is the longest of all the shortest paths in the graph. If everything is very tightly connected, then the diameter will be very short. Density: Density measures the potential of the entire network to talk to each other. It is the ratio of number of actual connections to total connections. Degree: Degree of a graph is the average number of edges associated with a vertex that is the number of direct connections a node has. Centrality Centrality ,measures the importance of the vertex. If the diameter is long, and the average length of all the shortest paths that go through a particular vertex is short, then it's not part of the diameter of the paths that define the diameter of the graph. And so, in some sense, it's maybe less central or less important. Degree Centrality: Degree centrality is a simple measure that indicates the overall number of connections for each actor in a network. It is calculated as the degree of a vertex divided by total number of edges. It measures the network activity of a node. Important nodes are those with high degree. However, more degree centrality is not always better. If a node acts as a hub and has connections only to those in its immediate cluster then that is not really a good thing. That node is not adding any value to the network in the real sense. What is more important is how do they connect to otherwise unconnected nodes. This brings us to the concept of betweenness centrality. Betweeness Centrality: Betweenness centrality is a measure which indicates the ease of connection with anybody else in the network, in particular, to try to connect potentially small subcommunities or subclusters of the nodes that may be happening in the network. Node with high Betweenness centrality is called network broker. A node with high betweenness plays a powerful role in the network, it has a great influence over what flows - and does not - in the network. It can also act as a point of failure and a bottleneck for information flow. Closeness Centrality: Closeness centrality is used to measure the ease of access to everybody else in the network. Closeness centrality indicates how quickly they can get to anybody else in a network. They have the shortest paths to all others - they are close to everyone else. They are in an excellent position to monitor the information flow in the network - they have the best visibility into what is happening in the network. Such nodes can act as leaders and are characterized by high achievement levels. Network Centralization A network dominated by a single or a few nodes is a very centralized network. Such networks are not desirable as they are prone to failure in event of damage or removal of the central node. If these nodes are removed or damaged, the network quickly fragments into unconnected sub-networks. A highly central node can become a single point of failure. Peripheral Players Nodes on the outer end of the network which are only loosely connected to the network play a key role of providing important resources for fresh information not available inside the network. Though they appear peripheral in context of one network they might have their own network and can prove to be a source of new ideas and information from other network. Benefits Social Network analysis has shown that our position in a network and our level of connectivity often determines our opportunities, level of influence, creativity etc. The network can also be used to measure social capital - the value that is generated by contribution of the nodes in network. Sone of the benefits which can be derived out of the social network analysis are as below: Information exchange and sharing: Tie strength is important in assessing the overall connectedness of actors in an environment and the likelihood that information will flow from one actor to another. Strong ties have long been considered to be conducive to the exchange of information. Those who are closely tied to others have more intimate ties and are more motivated to provide information to others. Information dissemination is fast and assured in such networks. Innovation and opportunities While strong and close ties motivates information exchange, it is better for individual success to have connections to a variety of networks rather than many connections within a single network to get wider access to information. Mark Granovetter found in one study that more numerous weak ties can be important in seeking information and innovation. He argued that ""those to whom we are weakly tied are more likely to move in circles different from our own and will thus have access to information different from that which we receive."" Cliques have a tendency to have more homogeneous opinions as they share many common traits resulting in members of the clusters to be attracted. However, the clusters will lack any new knowledge if they are not connected to other networks or subcommunities. Network brokers or nodes connecting subcommunities are highly associated with achievement and creativity as they have access to fresh ideas. Social Capital An individual dominated network is not desirable as it leaves little room for knowledge creation or generation of social capital. Rather, a desirable condition is to have all peers in the network with a similar network position. In these situations we can see that each individual in the network is equally contributing to the network towards knowledge generation. At the same time, each individual is also integrated into the network. Sense of community The sense of community indicates the extent to which individuals feel to belong to a particular community they are a part of. Sense of community can be an important predictor of employee retention in organization setup and of student's retention in universities. Peripheral nodes that appear to be isolated or sparsely connected to the rest of the network have a lower sense of community with respect to the network they are peripheral to. Shane Dawson has demonstrated that closeness and degree centrality are positively correlated with the sense of community while betweenness centrality is negatively associated. He argues that the students who are brokering between different small sub communities that are created in a network are typically investing much effort and time to broker between all these different connections. At the same time they don't feel that they receive much in return thereby resulting in poor sense of community. Achievement and Performance It has been shown in many different studies that performance in general is typically associated with different network centrality measures. Those individuals who have better and broader weak ties are better placed to have better performance, find a better job, or academically perform better. Outcome of a study showed that there was a strong significant association between closeness centrality, and eccentricity with the academic performance. While degree and betweenness centrality were not significantly associated with the academic achievement. This basically means that those students who are central in crossclass networks, that is to say those students who need to go through the lowest number of the other nodes to access some other node in the network, were best placed and had best academic performance. Applications In the field of medical research, social network analysis can be used understand the pattern of spread of epidemics and measures to control them. In the socio political environment, it can provide insight into the interplay between communication, sharing of information, spreading of rumor thereby allowing for preempt measures to prevent rioting, spreading of communal disharmony etc. In an organization it can help in decision making process by enabling the managers to understand the pattern of knowledge sharing. Identification of who knows who and who might know what can lead to better team building. Identification of teams and individuals playing central roles or thought leaders can boost innovation. Similarly, knowledge bottlenecks can be identified and strategies be worked out to improve knowledge flows. Employee retention can be improved by gauging their sense of community through social network analysis. In areas of marketing, rate of return can be improved by identifying the appropriate locations in a network which can enable quick dissemination of information about a product and influence other actors to adopt them. In the field of learning, instructors can find out about level of interest about a particular topic among the students and can accordingly strategize to improve the course content. Learning analytics and social network analysis can help instructors see what is happening inside of their classes. If the learners are having a low level of sense of community instructors can intervene and facilitate interaction among isolated students. Social network analysis can be used to monitor creative capacity of students and develop it. Social networks play a key role in hiring, in business success, and in job performance. Networks provide ways for companies to gather information, deter competition, and collude in setting prices or policies.",Blog,None,None,Week 6: Behavior Detection and Model Assessment > Behavior Detection and Model Assessmentcurrent section,6
4915222,5,F_NoOne,F_NoOne,"Interpretation and analysis of Social Networks - Part 1 | Given below is analysis of four simple networks. This analysis is an attempt to peek into the networks and make sense of their structure, the relationships among the actors so on and so forth. Network 1 Degree Boxplot Degree Distribution Degree centrality distribution show that there are couple of nodes which are not well connected to others but other nodes are well connected to each other and are as the same level. This implies that there is strong sense of community in the network. Information dissemination would be quite fast and owing to same level of connectivity of most of the nodes the network would do good in terms of social capital generation as most nodes would contribute to it. Betweeness Centrality: Betweenness Boxplot Betweenness Histogram Betweenness centrality distribution shows that very few (in fact only one ) node has high betweenness centrality. This shows that the network has only limited access or connectivity to other networks which means that scope of creativity and fresh ideas is limited. Also the network is at a potential risk of knowledge bottleneck. Closeness Centrality Distribution: Closeness Histogram Closeness Boxplot Most nodes are similarly positioned in terms of closeness centrality. The implies that the network nodes have access to opportunities and have a potential to perform good. Summary: Overall, the network is well integrated with a high sense of community. Information flow would be quick. There is a potential of good social capital generation. However, access to new ideas from outside is limited. So it does not score high in terms of innovation. It would be high on achievement and performance in general but low on innovation. Network 2 Degree Histogram Degree Boxplot Degree: One node has a very high degree and is well connected to others. Majority of nodes have degrees as 3. The network seems to be well connected overall. Node that has a high degree does not have a high betweeness showing that node is acting as a hub. Since the median centrality is 3, removal of this central node will not damage the network as other nodes are well integrated with each other. Network is not fragile and information flow in this network would be fast and most of the nodes would be contributing towards social capital as they are similarly placed in the network. Betweeness: Median betweenness centrality is 0.83 which is very low showing that most of the nodes are a part of a cluster. These chunk of nodes form the core of network and do not have much access to outer space. However there are couple of nodes which show high betweeness centrality thus linking other communities. So we can say that in this network there is adequate flow of fresh ideas which is good for innovation. Closeness Centrality: Barring a few outliers we see that among the other nodes which are well connected to each other the closeness centrality is not very skewed showing that most nodes are reasonably close to each other emphasizing that the network is well integrated. There are good numbers of leaders who occupy position of influence and are well positioned to access opportunities. The scatter plot shows that the node with the high betweenness centrality is the one with the closest to most nodes. The one with the highest degree does not have high betweeness. Summary: The network is not individual dominated which means that it is not fragile. It is well integrated as the degree distribution with close nodes is good which implies that it is good in terms of information exchange. Good distribution of high betweenness nodes means that there is good creative potential. Intercommunity links would give access to fresh ideas. It scores high on social capital as most nodes have a similar network position. It is not individual dominated. Enough number of leaders and influencers means that access to opportunities and performance levels would be high. Communities There are two prominent communities which are being analyzed. A dashboard showing the distribution of various centralities of the two communities is shown below: Centrality distribution of sub communities The distribution shows that both the communities differ in terms of degrees and closeness while the betweenness distribution is similar. While one community (identified here as Community 0) appears to be more integrated with nodes having higher sense of community. Nodes are much closer to each other showing that it comprises of high performing individuals. This network is also better in terms of social capital generation. It is more homogenous and clustered. Community 1 on the other seems to comprise of individuals who do not necessarily form a community. The underlying reason behind their integration is not a sense of community but quest for information. They appear to be less homogenous. They are constantly on lookout for new ideas implying that they are more creative. Interpretation and analysis of Social Networks - Part 2 | In continuation to my previous blog, here is the analysis of a blog and twitter sample network. Blog Degree: Degree distribution is right skewed. Median Degree is 1, Maximum degree is 55. It is a highly centralized network which makes it very fragile. Only one node has degree of 55. Nodes are very loosely connected and nebulous which implies low sense of community and lack of homogeneity. Centrality Boxplot Betweenness Histogram Betweeness vs closeness Scatter plot Closeness: Though closeness centrality ranges from 0.2 to 0.66, median is 3.4 and upper quartile is 3.57. Most of the nodes are not very close to each other confirming that the network is loose. Betweeness: It has highly right skewed distribution. There are a large number of nodes which have 0 betweeness. While only one node has a max of 0.22 betweeness centrality. The scatterplot shows that there are few active nodes which form the center of cluster and show high betweeness as well as closeness. Summary: The network is not homogenous and there is no sense of community. It is highly centralized, dominated by a few nodes making it highly fragile. Most of the nodes are attracted towards a node and since they do not have a similar postion it is scores poor on social capital generation. As the nodes lack homogeneity, the network would be a source of divergent ideas. There are few nodes which are very active in terms of collaborating with others and accessing new ideas. Modules: The network has been analyzed for four communities as shown below in the picture. Subcommunities Betweenness vs closeness Sub communities box plot distribution Community 1 has more members with better connectivity in contrast to Community 0 which only has a single member(may be the blogger) who has the maximum connection. The other two communities are relatively smaller. Though the blogger appears to be a part of Community, the other members in that community are not well connected among themselves. Blogger shows higher closeness and betweenness and links to another community 1. Community 1 shows relatively higher betweenness showing that the members have better access to new ideas and scores higher on creativity. Community 2 and 3 are very small don't seem to be very significant. Community 1 seems to be a prominent sub community in itself. Twitter Degree Histogram Degrees : Maximum degree is 99 while the median degree is 2. The graph is highly right skewed. The connections are very few and loose. There are a lot of peripheral players. It is dominated by 4-5 players who can said to be forming core of their sub communities. There are more players in the periphery than in the core. Since the median degree is 2, the network is very fragile. Removal of the few core components can render the network broken. Betweeness Box plot Closeness box plot Betweeness: Between centrality is negligible for almost all of the nodes. Only a few nodes have relatively higher betweeness. Closeness: Five num summary for closeness centrality is: 0.19, 0.27, 0.27, 0.32, 0.39. The maximum is 0.49. The scatterplot between betweenness and closeness centrality is shown below: Betweenness vs Closeness Summary: We can say that the network consists of a community whose core shows the maximum degrees, betweenneess and closeness centrality. This core node in turn connects with the various smaller sub communities. Network would be fragile. Nodes forming the core of subcommunities would score good on creativity and leadership. The intermediate nodes which are clustered around various core would be more homogenous and would score good on achievement and performance. They have access to fresh ideas from the weak ties with the peripheral nodes as well as information and influence from the core nodes which could said to be leaders in their own field. Communities The network has been analyzed for 7 sub communities. Sub communities Scatter plot One of the communities labeled here as Community 1 is the largest. It can be said to be the core of the network around which various sub communities have emanated. The core of this network would be comprised of very knowledgeable and important nodes ranking high on influence and leadership. Several other nodes that are important in their own field seem to have connected to this code. These nodes form the core of their own communities which in turn are followed by the nodes which are more homogenous. We can say that various sub communities specialize in different field and the entire network thus is good source of knowledge put together from divergent areas. It would score good in the field of innovation but low on sense of community. It is fragile with not so good information flow with a risk of information bottleneck.","Blog,Blog",None,None,"Week 6: Behavior Detection and Model Assessment > Behavior Detection and Model Assessmentcurrent section,Week 5: Prediction Modeling > Bonus Videos: Voices From the Field current section,Week 7: Text Mining Introduction > Text Mining Introduction,Week 6: Behavior Detection and Model Assessment > Bonus Videos: Voices From the Field current section","5,7,6"

1048584,0,F_NoOne,F_NoOne,"MOOC - change education? MOOCs have been around for a few years. I have flitted about the edges of a couple of different MOOCs but never had a desire to attend one all the way through to completion of the course. Now I have one I am interested in and fits a need for me to grow in using data and data analytics in education. It is an EdX course called - ""Data, Analytics, and Learning."" I am eager to get started for two reasons. The topics and content of the course fits a need for me to learn more about data and analytics. The second is the unique MOOC this is turning out to be. This MOOC is trying to challenge the traditional (if you can call it traditional when it only has been around for a couple of years) MOOC design. Instead of a steady flow of content from instructor to student this MOOC is trying to get the students connecting with each other and creating. I am interested in seeing how this will play out too. Excited to start the learning! This blog will be my home base for the work from the course. So I am both trying a new style MOOC and also trying out this Indie Web concept of posting on a site I control and then posting other places. Let the experiment or experiments begin! MOOC - Introduction It has been an interesting process learning how this newly designed MOOC that uses both the social and content pathways. It has taken watching a few videos to really understand how the course will work and expectations along the way. The Edx and the Prosolo parts still have an interesting relationship in my mind. At first I had them segmented as the content and work would be in Edx and the social mainly in Prosolo. Now I am finding that through the Plan, Learn, and Profile in Prosolo there is a list of assignments in Prosolo. I think I am starting to get the hang of how they fit together. I like this idea of posting your work in your own space be it Twitter, blog, or other space. You own the learning and then it is shared with the group. Great way to go! It will be interesting to see this play out over the weeks in the course. On the content presented about learning analytics the definition was helpful: ""Learning analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs."" I am also interested to learn more about analytics around other areas then the academic content, like social interactions, different spaces, etc. I would be interested in how analytics could be used around a portfolio of student work too. I am very new to learning analytics so hearing about some of the tools we will be using was very helpful. It was reassuring that some of tools mentioned I had looked into over the last few weeks. Tableau I have been testing the last two weeks and find it a great tool for visualizing data. I have begun adding some of the other tools I have found into the Learning Analytics: Tool Matrix document. Hopefully I can continue to add to the document as tools are shared by the group. That is all for now.","Blog,Blog",None,None,"Course Orientation > DALMOOC Course Basics,Course Orientation > Orientation Hangouts",1

I am currently working on a project to integrate coding techniques (mainly Java and Android) into science education. I am hopeful that this course may give me some insights on how to do something similar with regards to data analysis.,Post,"SRL.Planning.TaskAnalysis,SRL.Engagement.ApplyingStrategyChanges,SRL.Engagement.ApplyingStrategyChanges,SRL.Planning.GoalSetting,SRL.EvaluationReflection.Evaluation,SRL.Planning.TaskAnalysis,SRL.Engagement.ApplyingStrategyChanges,SRL.Planning.GoalSetting,SRL.EvaluationReflection.Evaluation,SRL.Planning.TaskAnalysis,SRL.Planning.TaskAnalysis,SRL.Planning.TaskAnalysis","Interventions.StatusWall.Main,Interventions.Suggestions.People,Interventions.Suggestions.People,Interventions.StatusWall.Main,Interventions.StatusWall.Main,Interventions.StatusWall.Main","Course Orientation > DALMOOC Course Basics,Course Orientation > Orientation Hangouts,Week 1: Introduction to Learning Analytics (LA) > Introduction to Learning Analytics",1

4784163,0,F_NoOne,SF_GoalBystander,"DALMOOC - Catching up! I have joined a new MOOC, but this is not the best start for me. When I heard about the course a week ago it had already started. And I did not get around to work seriously with it until this week end. But here I am, a student of <<Data, Analytics, and Learning>> offered by UT Arlington. The catch up has started! The course invites the participants to interact on many platforms inside and outside of EdX, and to be fairly independent of a syllabus and instead base themselves on social/peer learning. That is very exciting, but another reason why catching up does not make all that much sense in this course. All the more reason to get through the introductory lectures and assessments fast, to get to where everyone else is. I guess that is where the social learning takes place. Actually the first competency was a bit of a challenge for me. I am supposed to identify tools online that are commonly used in Learning Analytics. This field is so new to me that I am not even quite sure of what it is yet. Of course I see analytical tools in use all around me. For example, earlier today I logged my workout from this morning in an online Crossfit log service. Besides me using it for my own purposes this data is being <<mined>> for insights that the company uses to write blog posts about the best work out practices. As a teacher I have also seen how performance data from my students can be a good corrective that helps me help them in their learning. But that can hardly be regarded <<big data>>, and my use of those data is all but automated. In my searching for analytical tools online, i came accross one that looked promising to me: Scrapy is a tool for extracting data from websites. I guess we could call it datamining? I also found NodeXL : a free, open-source template for MicrosoftExcel, that helps to build and explore network graphs. However, the natural focus for me now, would be on the tool that we will use for the first couple of weeks in this mooc: Tableau . And by doing that experience more of the whats and hows of Learning Analytics.",Blog,SRL.Planning.TaskAnalysis,"Interventions.Suggestions.People,Interventions.Suggestions.People,Interventions.StatusWall.Main","Week 2: Starting With Data > Starting With Data,Course Orientation > Orientation Hangouts,Week 1: Introduction to Learning Analytics (LA) > Video: Welcome to Week 1 Hangout Archive,Course Orientation > DALMOOC Course Basics,Week 1: Introduction to Learning Analytics (LA) > Introduction to Learning Analytics,Week 1: Introduction to Learning Analytics (LA) > Video: Archive of ProSolo & Assessment in DALMOOC","1,2"

IrTwitterPost IrTwitterPost IrTwitterPost IrTwitterPost IrTwitterPost Figuring out what are we trying to figure out is one of the big aspects of data analysis. We collect data to answer questions, but now knowing what the questions are in the first place, can make data all but useless. To assume a centralized posture on Social Networks it is important to engage horizontally as much as vertically. Being creative can be as simple as providing a fresh prospective into external networks. It's all in the data sample; if the sample is flawed the results will be flawed.. IrTwitterPost Slightly tangential to #dalmooc . Very interesting nonetheless URL Each one of us is the center of our Social Network.

IrTwitterPost IrTwitterPost IrTwitterPost IrTwitterPost IrTwitterPost Who MOOCed My Cheese? #dalmooc URL IrTwitterPost IrTwitterPost Who MOOCed My Cheese?l Conversations behind the scenes with the DALMOOC have turned to looking at the kind of feedback we have been getting on the course. George Siemens shared some of the things that he learned the first week . His post also deals with some of the feedback we have received. The hard part with dealing with feedback is that most of us end up with a skewed view of it after a while. Positive feedback is usually pretty general and therefore easy to forget because its not very specific. Everything from ""this looks great!"" to ""I am loving this!"" to ""I really like what you are doing here"" serves as great feedback, but because of the general nature and lack of specifics tend to be easily forgotten. Negative feedback tends to be specific and direct. This makes it a lot easier to remember. People will tell you exactly what they don't like and a dozen reasons why they don't like it. Because of this skew, the negative feedback tends to stick in our mind more easily and we also tend to get the impression that there is more negative than positive. This becomes a problem when we begin to make design decisions based on gut feelings rather than hard numbers. If you count up the positive and negative feedback, which one is higher? If you take a qualitative look at what was said, is there anything helpful either way? Saying ""I love this"" really just indicates a personal preference more than an actual analysis that a designer should take into consideration. In the same way, ""I don't like this"" is also really just a personal preference that really doesn't tell us much about design. Learning is not all puppy dogs and fairy tales - sometimes you have to create situations where learners have to choose to stretch and grow in order to learn. There is nothing wrong with some struggle in learning. Often, complaints about learners not liking something are actually good indicators that your design is successful. If you disagree, that is fine. But don't design anything that involves group work. A lot of people hate group work and if you create a lesson that requires group work, you have just acknowledged that sometimes you have to struggle through group dynamics in order to learn whether you like it or not :) But sometimes when someone says ""I don't know what to do with this tool!"" what they are really saying is ""I am not sure what to do and I don't want to try because in the past there have been huge penalties for trying and getting it wrong on the first try!"" This is a sad indication of our educational systems in general. We don't make it okay to experiment, fail, and learn from failure. The reason so many people demand more tutorials, more hand-holding, more guidance is not because they afraid of chaos as much as they are afraid that they will get their hand slapped for not getting it right the first time. This is likely due to it almost always happening in the past. So in something like DALMOOC, where you are free to get in and experiment and fail as much as you want to, most of us have been conditioned to panic in that kind of scenario. That's what our excessive focus on instructivism does to us as a society. People are afraid to play around and possibly fail for a while. They want to know the one right way to do something, with 10 easy steps for doing it right the first time. So, in a lot of ways, much of the feedback we are getting is along the lines of ""who moved my cheese?"" And that was expected. We are trying to jump in and explain things to those who are confused as much as possible. We are hoping that those who are bringing up personal preferences as negatives will see that we had to design for the widest range of learners. Or maybe to see that if they still figured something out, that this thing actually worked as designed (because its not always about personal preferences as much as learning). But, to be quite honest, an objective examination of all feedback would seem to indicate that most of it is positive. Many of you like the challenges and the struggles. That is great - you get it. Most of the positive and negative feedback is along the lines of personal preferences - you don't like rollover effects, you love Bazaar, this optional assignment is too hard, this required one is too easy. I'll continue blogging on design decisions to clarify why they were made - not to justify them as right (instructional design is rarely about black and white, right and wrong decisions anyways), but to explain why they were made. And there are some genuine complaints about confusion that we are addressing. Just as us instructors and designers can develop a negative skew, so can the learners. They can see a few specific negative tweets in a sea of general positive tweets and start to think ""wow - maybe I should be having more problems?"" Don't worry - most people are doing just fine. Problems, praises, issues, suggestions, and complaints are welcome, but just remember they don't necessarily apply to you as a learner. You are free to love or hate any part of the course you wish. You are also free to pick and choose the parts of the course you participate in, so don't waste time with something that isn't working for you. But also be careful not to label something as ""not working for you"" just because you don't like it or are struggling with it. Sometimes the struggle is the exact thing that you need in order to learn.

425990,5,F_GoalBystander,F_GoalBystander,"DALMOOC Design and Scaffolding #dalmooc URL IrTwitterPost DALMOOC Design and Scaffolding Returning again to the design of DALMOOC and more specifically the visual syllabus , I wanted to take a look at the scaffolding decisions that were made. In some ways, this course was a unique challenge because we had to do some true scaffolding that could possible span several different levels of experience, from complete newbie to seasoned expert. This is different than most instances of scaffolding, because typically college curses are really more along the lines of linear constructivism than scaffolding. What I mean is this: for most courses on the college level, you assume that your learners have a prerequisite level of knowledge from either high school or earlier pre-req courses. You aren't introducing, say, physics for the first time ever - but instead you are building on the Intro to Physics course in order to help students learn how to build rockets and predict launch patterns. So you don't scaffold as much as take chunks of knowledge and skills and plug them into (linear constructivism) existing knowledge. This is scaffolding at the basic level, but you may or may not go beyond one level of scaffolding. With DALMOOC, we knew that learning analytics is still new for many, but old news for some that may just want to learn some different tools. Additionally, we were adding in new technology that we knew for a fact that no one had ever used. Throw in that mix an international crowd that won't all be speaking English and then even add the idea to create a visual syllabus (which few are familiar with). This is a tall order covering a huge range that most courses don't have to consider. So where to start? Well, with the first page of the syllabus. It needed to be visual, with minimal text, but clear where to start. A wall of text that basically says ""start here"" kind of violates a lot of what it needed to be. But if you look at anything from OLC to Quality Matters, most online course evaluation tools recommend having a clear and simple indication of where to start. What is more simple and easy to understand than a basic ""1, 2, 3, etc""? I have traveled to Asia and Europe and Africa and even people who don't know English still understand enough about our number system to know that a web page with those numbers on them would indicate you start with number 1. Of course, a small number of people felt that this was still too confusing. I'm not sure what to say to that. You are presented with a page that says ""Welcome to the Class"" and then some big buttons that are labeled 1, 2, 3, etc. I'm not sure what is simpler than that. Of course, I realize that there are those that really, really need the text because they have been programmed to look for it their whole lives. The buttons were given a rollover effect that gives a more detailed description of what they are leading to. This serves two purposes. One, it gives detailed descriptions that are there when you need them, but aren't filling the screen and overwhelming people that are completely new. Two, they make you actually do something with the syllabus instead of just passively reading a wall of text. You have to mouse over or click on various items to get more details. This moves you from passive to (slightly) active. This was on purpose to get learners engaging more with the content on the very first page. Additionally, this idea was continued on the other various visuals. For those that are not new to all of this, links were provided on the upper right hand corner - where they usually are on most websites. We don't expect people to follow the path laid out for them. In fact, we encouraged learners to skip around and make their own path as needed. And that was also possible from the design. As expected, there was some push back from a few learners (about 5-10 out of the 6,000 that were active at some point) on the design. The basic feedback was that they didn't like the roll over effects. They wanted the text to be there without rolling over. This probably tells me that the right decision was made, because that was exactly what the rollover effects were designed to do: make the learner do something instead of passively absorbing text. Of course, there are other ways to accomplish the same goal, so other ideas might be used in the future. The biggest challenge in describing the structure was how to explain the nature of the dual layer course. Course themes are always helpful, as the many versions of ds106 have proven. Of course, it would have been nice to have enough time to have carried out the theme for the whole class. Many of the problems with understanding the structure can probably be traced to the fact that we were not able to inject this theme throughout the entire course (of course, those problems could also come from the fact that we initially designed the daily email to be the central anchor for the course (and therefore, the place were scaffolding and structure sense-making would happen)). It seems like that aspect fell short. However, I think that a consistent theme that is carried throughout the course as a true sensemaking/guidance tool would alleviate many of these issues. Of course, scaffolding in general is a problematic concept in this dual layer approach, but that will have to be a topic for another blog post. The theme itself was chosen early as an initial idea that ended up sticking. I think the Matrix ""blue pill/red pill"" theme was a good place to start, but gets a little murky once people start mixing the two and bringing in their own ideas (which is, of course, what we want). My first idea was actually a table full of play-dough - all kinds of colors just waiting for learners to pick and choose and make into whatever they like. Ultimately, this leaned too much towards my connectivism bias and was probably too unstructured for new learners who wanted instructivism. I think that a mixture of the two ideas might work as a better theme in the future: learners are initially given the choice of blue or red play-dough, but they can choose one or the other or mix together to make their own shade of purple - or bring in their own colors to create what they want. Of course, some of the more complex ideas that were thrown around earlier, like creating scaffolding out of objectives or dynamic group formation and changing , never made it into the course. Interestingly enough, some learners (around 10-15) asked for various versions of these ideas, so they may bear exploration in the future. Underlying these design decisions were some different theoretical perspectives that go beyond Connectivism and Instructivism (LTCA Theory, Heutagogy, Metamodernism, etc) that will need to be explored in a future blog post.

622596,1,F_NoOne,F_NoOne,"Link to my blog on first assignment http://simonfala.wordpress.com/2014/10/26/first-assignment/ Waiting in the Bazaar lobby... And so it begins Home So three or so hours of videos in and we finally get to find out what we're going to learn. 3 hours without a learning objective - I'd get hammered at work. I can't decide if the amateurish nature of presentation thus far is endearing or irritating. Overwhelmed by the options, there's definitely something to be said for structure. It's lonely out here... I may have just said Hi to an uninterested Bazaar System administrator, and this was the response: later, then. First Assignment Here's the first assignment. List of analytics software, with added bits from me. Bits being an appropriate adjective when looking at the scale of what I've done. Still not entirely sure what I'm learning yet, so I'm yet to judge how much I'll get back from the effort I put in. Therefore minimal effort. I really don't understand the structure of 'competencies'. Have I now completed the week 1 competencies by publishing a blog with my matrix on and participating in the Bazaar activity, where-in I had a, albeit limited, discussion about what LA was? IrTwitterPost Tony Hirst on Data Wrangling Thoughts: 'Tukey', that's a name I've encountered before but can't remember where. 'datey things' Open Refine - downloading now - worth looking at. But what does it do that R can't do, or even Excel. Tree Map, Sankey diagrams. Lot of glitching. Makes me wonder how much planning went into this. Any teacher knows you can't just expect things to work. I can't see how hard it can be to run something like this. If Jonah Matranga, a slightly crazed punk rock singer can manage to broadcast a live show (on Giving Stage) without any real glitches, why do these 'academics' struggle so much? Well the bit at the beginning threatened to be interesting, then became too specialised. There then seemed to be a race the other way by giving really simple data analysis by looking at different types of charts. Pinally, a lecture quite in keeping with the rest of the course. Lots of small hints of learning, some possible interesting topics to look further into, but no structure and no real narrative left it feeling a mess and me still wondering if I've learnt anything. 'a datey thing' #DALMOOC Tableau Home I found most of the tutorials confusing and a little irritating (probably due to the heavy amount of sales spiel). Finally found a dataset I could use and dove in that way. Then the tutorials made a little more sense. And I learnt a little of how to use Tableau. I enjoyed the tree diagrams and bubble plots. I can see how the ability to drill down on individual data points would be handy (particularly for outliers or interesting points). However, as is currently the way with this course, I'm left wondering a) Have I actually learnt anything yet? b) If I have learnt something, will it be of any use. Waiting for the Bazaar again... Fail... IrTwitterPost Tableau stuff http://wp.me/p5g3Dh-k Hey! Look at my mess! (Learning) Here's a link to the files I made whilst messing about with (learning) Tableau. TableauStuff It's not very polished, but I like it as a 'stage' in my learning. I can see where I've fought with the package and the data. I even had to 'clean' the data a little. Adding in a column for absolute values instead of running percentages for each grade. I think I also had a 'datey thing'. In the spreadsheet some data are labelled 2012, some 2011. Tableau wanted to treat this as a numerical range, even when I formatted it to text in the spreadsheet. Then I remembered you can change the behaviour of a column in the initial load screen, so that was problem solved. I like the bubble diagrams where colour can give the display a third dimension. On my diagram, I've gone with grades of C or above in size then added A* as colour. Like I said it's very messy, but I believe that you learn in your mistakes and should therefore revel in them somewhat. I tell my pupils to do this, so I need to practice it too.

Discussed this question briefly in my, actually quite worthwhile, Bazaar chat this week. I t seems like it's so far out of my scope of current understanding of learning analytics that I literally do not know where to start. The question is a symptom of what I believe might be a large problem in learning analytics - too much bloody jargon! 'Strategic Planning', 'systems-level deployment' - are these terms used in the 'real' world? Not a real world I'm from. So in summary the impact of policy and strategic planning on systems-level deployment of learning analytics will be minimal, along with the impact of learning analytics itself, until the practitioners learn to communicate effectively with those who might benefit from it.

Im a learning technologist in the UK, where this field has now been renamed Technology Enhanced Learning. One of my favourite questions at the moment is What is enhanced and how do we know? (addressed by Kirkwood and Price in this paper  http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439884.2013.770404#.VEy_QldA2xc). So, I would like to use analytics/big data to help find answers to questions in this area. As a specific example, my institution is rolling out lecture capture to improve the quality of the learning and teaching provision for students. But can the data show us that there are improvements in learning? Usage data shows us that the recorded lectures are used, but how are they used? Do the lecture recordings encourage students to focus too much on the lecture content rather than reading more widely on the topic? Does the ability to revisit the content of a lecture prevent students building up personal support networks among peers or raising questions with the lecturer? Are the recordings of greater value to those for whom English is not their first language? To answer these questions requires data from many sources. Is it all available? At the right level of detail? Identifiable to individual students? How can it be gathered and processed? And what are the ethical and legal issues that must be considered?

IrTwitterPost IrTwitterPost IrTwitterPost I'm ok - I'm in a boat. :) IrTwitterPost Navigating #DALMOOC - all at sea | E for Enhancing In the discussion forums on the #DALMOOC course, George Siemens (one of the course organisers) urges learners to create artifacts, draw or create ""a concept map of the course technologies in order to make sense of (wayfind through) the course."" So, here is my word picture of trying to wayfind and sensemake in #DALMOOC. On the blue layer I am sitting alone in a small rowing boat with no paddle, while automated-Carolyn shouts through a loud hailer - ""Time to move on"". On the red layer I am again sitting alone in a small rowing boat, but this time overwhelmed and weighed down by many fantastical Heath-Robinson-style tools of unclear purpose. I understand the value of finding my own way through the course content, making my own connections, building my own learning space, but I fail to see the benefit of an obscure course structure that impacts on my time available for learning. Thankfully the course team are now beginning to provide a few more signposts. (Signposts at sea? - I may be getting my metaphors crossed.)

360460,1,F_NoOne,F_NoOne,"#dalmooc #Tutorial52 URL Tableau Stories - BizzyPeople A feature of Tableau I hadn't used before is the story tool. This enables you to add 'slides' for sheets or dashboards to be added, which can then be annotated. The nice feature is that each 'slide' can be filtered in any way that I'd like, so the same sheet can appear twice, each with different annotations and filters. As this is all linked to data that can be updated, it looks like an easy way to prepare for regular presentations. This is all way easier than trying to remember which item to click on a sheet or dashboard. The Presentation mode will be familiar to PowerPoint users, but the data is still capable of being filtered so that questions could be fielded if another aspect of the data needed to be explored. If the audience doesn't have access to Tableau, printing the worksheet to a PDF creates a a sheet for each slide. While not interactive, this still makes for an interesting reports format.

Elderly parents, wives and cats have a low tolerance to being displaced by earnest intent for an outcome they don't share in. The course leaders are, undoubtedly, really nice people who clearly articulate expertise and a passion for the subject matter but there is a nagging feeling that the course content is already getting ahead of me. HOW MANY ASSIGNMENTS JUST APPEARED!?!?! OK I only have four to look at, but I'm already in week 2. I thought I was just going to be looking at the basic functionality of Tableau and reading a few papers, but I find myself doing very little on the latter and trying to digest a book (the excellent - just not Chapter 1, sorry - Teaching Crowds by Dron and Anderson). I've had to take a deep breath, relax and accept I'm a constructivist by nature. I really don't need badges or tokens of status and the warm appreciation of my peers, though welcome, doesn't drive me. It must be my age. I'd rather discover learning objectives as I go along and I'm realising that the knowledge I need for those probably won't come exclusively from DALMOOC. It has helped me understand the 'high drop-out rate' from a different angle. I might apparently drop out (or just occasionally dip in) but that doesn't mean that I've left the personal 'course' that it initiated. Learning Technologist As a champion for the use of technology in teaching you really can't let the side down by throwing your hand in when it comes to technology. Be bold, have a backup plan, but push the boundaries! But when it comes to being on the receiving end of some truly woeful experiences the spirit sags. It is clear that mainstream 'academic' social networking applications, on the whole, suck. While I was amused by George's comment that the chat rooms would be useful, though containing less nudity than usual, in reality I must confess that sexting holds more appeal (and I promise you that is zero) than trying to engage in discourse this way. I can't type and think at the same time beyond the inane, hence a chat with a truly lovely professor in the US was a less than helpful learning moment. You just get bored waiting for a reply and type something, so three or four strands of conversation develop that get really disjointed. The Real Ale one was probably the best in my opinion and I suspect my chat partner would say the same. I'm never doing the chat thing again and I could never recommend it - the promise of synchronous communication with the hiatus of asynchronicity. While installing and testing Gephi I used Netvizz to extract Facebook data, the quantity and depth is horrifying, yet fascinating, and I would strongly urge any Facebook user to be aware how vulnerable your interactions in a group or with friends are to analysis. Choose your friends and group members carefully and don't agree to release data to researchers until you have explored these two tools. Course design facilitator Overall, I think the DALMOOC course designers have demonstrated a flexibility and openness to criticism that is something you'd like all course teams to replicate. This is a big course, lots of students and new applications were being trialed so reacting on the fly isn't easy, especially when the team are moving around at the same time There were some obvious issues when the course kicked off: it was hard to find a 'centre' for course material and assignments and this was quickly rectified; ProSolo has something of a steep learning curve; the chat room system didn't really have the new life breathed in to it promised, largely because it was too clunky to redeem. If I had any criticism it would be the content of some activities. Collecting reviews of relevant educational software in a Word document just isn't going to work unless someone merges them together, so the opportunity to construct a useful artifact was lost. And while the Tableau sample worksheet is fine to start out with, it would have been so much better if at least one more relevant dataset and perhaps an example worksheet from it was provided. Finally, the idea of discussing the institutional policy of one's home base in an open MOOC like this has a hint of the naive. I might be approaching retirement and give less of a damn than most, but this is pretty thin ice! OK, criticising content in a MOOC that is designed to generate much more than it starts with may seem churlish, but it needs to set a standard. Perhaps one higher than this blog! Now what ... I'm clearly going to persist. The MOOC has given me some ideas about developing ways of recording discourse in a non-linear fashion (which collided with an idea from a colleague, Graham Smith, about argument mapping software). I've already been amazed at the way relationships can be extracted from Facebook. The power to abuse groups is pretty scary, so I must understand the social network analysis tools better. you'd need to extract the text (Google pdf2txt) and clean it, but postscript can split text up. or ask the report generator to use a different format like csv","RelTwitterPost,Blog,RelTwitterPost,RelTwitterPost,IrTwitterPost,Blog,RelTwitterPost,RelTwitterPost",None,None,None,None

360460,6,F_NoOne,F_NoOne,"Data visualisation at NILE External resources thinglink is a free picture annotation tool that allows content to be linked to external resources. YouTube/ Vimeo / Soundcloud clips are embedded directly inside the same window. It is also possible to open a free teacher account which allows you to create logins for students so that they can share their work with you. While this isn't the most intuitive process, it does generate a username and log in for them that does not require them to agree to any terms and conditions - their accounts are administered as part of yours. So - in theory - this could be used as part of an assignment, though administratively this isn't really practical for more than a handful of students. The thinglink editor includes a search facility to add 'hot spots' or they can be added manually. The free version only allows links (which are displayed intelligently when the are used to access sites with identifiable content: see the Wikipedia example below) and plain text. Links which Adding links to Kaltura video is not quite so simple as the direct URL link is not available from within NILE at present - you will have to contact learntech@northampton.ac.uk with details of your videos and they will be able to provide links for you. Possible uses are as a 'visual portal' for students to access further or - if the thinglink is set to public - as an activity where students can add links and annotations to a shared picture as a class or within a group. The 'Tank' example below demonstrates this behaviour - no login is required to edit it. A modern browser is likely to be required though. In addition to the Web version, IOS and Android editing tools are also available and there is good integration into common social media tools to share results. The paid version allows rich text to be added to pop-ups and video annotations are also possible. Examples These examples were created using the iframe embed code generated by 'Share this image' (image size can be set at the same time - 800 x 600 is probably best for NILE embedding). This iframe code will work correctly when embedded in a content item using the HTML editor. This thinglink is publicly editable, without a login. It can't be 'Touched' (or 'Liked') without one though. This thinglink is private. There are colour coded links to parts on the left, external links on the right.",Blog,None,None,None,None

360465,0,F_NoOne,SF_GoalBystander,"Off on the wrong foot I started the Digital Analytics and Learning MOOC - DALMOOC, this week. George Siemens and his co-conspirators describe it as a dual-layer MOOC, although it seems to me that dual-track would be a better term. The idea is that one can complete the MOOC either by following the traditional path of content followed by assignments or by following a social path where one is given a problem to solve and then finds some kindred spirits, goes forth and solves. This sounds great in theory. My reality of it hasn't been great so far. First, I'm not clear where to go to find the problems and connect with other learners on the ""social"" track. I'm looking for some sort of hub for this layer of the MOOC and haven't found it yet. Second, The first assignment seems to be to gather information on learning analytics tools. One does this by downloading an MS Word document and filling it out. I am hard pressed to think of a less social way to approach this task. Finally, I worry that the course may do a wonderful job of teaching about tools, while leaving out important stuff like how to figure out which data is important and useful. That's the most important thing to learn about learning analytics.",Blog,"SRL.Planning.TaskAnalysis,SRL.Engagement.ApplyingStrategyChanges,SRL.Engagement.ApplyingStrategyChanges,SRL.Engagement.ApplyingStrategyChanges,SRL.Planning.GoalSetting,SRL.Planning.TaskAnalysis","Interventions.Suggestions.People,Interventions.Suggestions.People,Interventions.Suggestions.People,Interventions.Suggestions.People,Interventions.Suggestions.People","Course Orientation > DALMOOC Course Basics,Week 1: Introduction to Learning Analytics (LA) > Introduction to Learning Analytics",1
